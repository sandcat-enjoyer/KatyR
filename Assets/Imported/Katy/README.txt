This package contains a didimo.

Inside you will find the core avatar file:

"avatar_model.fbx": your didimo in industry-standard FBX format.

Along with the following texture files:
"ddmo_head_albedo.jpg": albedo map texture covering the head and face
"ddmo_head_normal.png": normal map texture covering the head and face
"ddmo_head_AO.jpg": ambient occlusion map texture covering the head and face
"ddmo_head_cavity.jpg": cavity map texture covering the head and face
"ddmo_head_micronormal.png": micro normal map texture covering the head and face
"ddmo_head_rough.jpg": roughness map texture covering the head and face
"ddmo_head_spec.jpg": specular map texture covering the head and face
"ddmo_head_SSS_AO_mask.png": determines by how much the subsurface scattering contribution is modulated with the ambient occlusion map on head and face
"ddmo_head_trans.jpg": translucency map texture covering the head and face
"ddmo_mouth_albedo.jpg": albedo map texture covering the mouth
"ddmo_mouth_normal.png": normal map texture covering the mouth
"ddmo_mouth_AO.jpg": ambient occlusion map texture covering the mouth
"ddmo_eye_albedo.png": albedo map texture covering the eyes
"ddmo_eye_normal.png": normal map texture covering the eyes
"ddmo_eyelashes_albedo_opacity.png": albedo opacity map texture covering the eyelashes
"ddmo_body_albedo.jpg": albedo map texture covering the body
"ddmo_body_normal.png": normal map texture covering the body
"ddmo_body_AO.jpg": ambient occlusion map texture covering the body
"ddmo_body_cavity.jpg": cavity map texture covering the body
"ddmo_body_micronormal.png": micro normal map texture covering the body
"ddmo_body_rough.jpg": roughness map texture covering the body
"ddmo_body_spec.jpg": specular map texture covering the head and face
"ddmo_body_SSS_AO_mask.png": determines by how much the subsurface scattering contribution is modulated with the ambient occlusion map on the body
"ddmo_body_trans.jpg": translucency map texture covering the body
"ddmo_body_clothing_mask.png": clothing mask covering the body
"ddmo_clothing_albedo_opacity.png": albedo opacity map texture covering the clothing
"ddmo_clothing_normal.png": normal map texture covering the clothing
"ddmo_clothing_AO.jpg": ambient occlusion map texture covering the clothing
"ddmo_clothing_metal_rough.jpg": roughness and metallic map textures covering the clothing
"ddmo_hair_albedo_opacity.png": albedo opacity map texture covering the hair

Extras:
"deformation_matrix.dmx": to be used with deformation endpoints
"metadata.json": includes metadata about the package
"avatar_info.json": companion file that specifies didimo meta information (texture maps, animation frames)

Instructions for the use of your didimo:
----------------------------------------

The provided FBX file includes both the mesh geometry of the didimo, and an attached facial skeleton for animation and posing.

To use your didimo inside a project or application, import the FBX file using an appropriate FBX importer. Most 3D applications and game frameworks will provide this functionality as part of their standard model import procedure.

Sometimes the textures may have to be assigned manually, according to the application.

Enjoy your didimo!
